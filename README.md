## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCss](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
I learn TailwindCss Framework.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
```Tailwindcss
<img class="w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48" src="{ImageDesktop}">
`````

### Continued development

In Future, I will continue to focus on how to used styled components with tailwindCss and also get vast with JS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/) - This helped me for with styling the webpages. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
